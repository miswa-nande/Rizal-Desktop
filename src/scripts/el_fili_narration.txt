EL FILIBUSTERISMO (The Reign of Greed)
Published: 1891 in Ghent, Belgium

OVERVIEW:
"El Filibusterismo" is Dr. José Rizal's second and final novel, serving as the darker, more politically charged sequel to "Noli Me Tangere." Published in Ghent, Belgium in 1891, this novel presents a more revolutionary and pessimistic view of Philippine society under Spanish colonial rule. The title "El Filibusterismo" refers to the Spanish term for "filibustering" or subversive activities, reflecting the novel's exploration of revolution and its consequences.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
Rizal wrote this novel during a period of increasing frustration with the failure of peaceful reform efforts in the Philippines. By 1891, it had become clear that the Spanish government and the friars had no intention of implementing the reforms that Filipino ilustrados had been advocating for. This disillusionment is reflected in the novel's darker tone and its exploration of violent revolution as a response to oppression.

The novel was published with financial difficulties, and Rizal dedicated it to the memory of the three Filipino priests—Fathers Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (collectively known as GOMBURZA)—who were executed in 1872 for their alleged involvement in the Cavite Mutiny. This dedication underscores the novel's themes of martyrdom and the price of seeking justice.

PLOT SUMMARY:
The story takes place thirteen years after the events of "Noli Me Tangere." The protagonist is Simoun, a wealthy and mysterious jeweler who has gained the confidence of the Spanish colonial government. In reality, Simoun is Crisostomo Ibarra, who survived his apparent death at the end of the first novel and has returned in disguise.

Having abandoned his earlier idealism and belief in peaceful reform, Simoun now seeks revenge against the system that destroyed his life and took María Clara from him. He has spent years accumulating wealth and influence, and now uses his position to manipulate the colonial government, encouraging their greed and corruption to hasten the system's collapse.

Simoun's plan is to incite a revolution by exacerbating the injustices and abuses of the colonial system. He hopes that by making conditions unbearable, the Filipino people will rise up in armed rebellion. His ultimate goal is to rescue María Clara from the convent and destroy the corrupt society that has caused so much suffering.

The novel follows several interconnected storylines:

BASILIO'S STORY: Basilio, one of Sisa's sons from the first novel, has grown up and is now a medical student. He represents the new generation of educated Filipinos who still believe in peaceful reform through education and hard work.

THE STUDENT MOVEMENT: A group of students, including Isagani and Macaraig, attempt to establish a Spanish language academy for Filipinos, believing that education and cultural assimilation will lead to equality. Their efforts are repeatedly thwarted by the friars and Spanish officials.

SIMOUN'S CONSPIRACY: Simoun manipulates various characters and situations, pushing the colonial government toward increasingly oppressive policies. He provides weapons and encourages discontent, preparing for a violent uprising.

The climax occurs during a wedding celebration where Simoun plans to detonate a bomb hidden in a lamp, killing the Spanish elite and sparking a revolution. However, Isagani, who still loves Paulita Gómez (the bride), discovers the plot and throws the lamp into the river, preventing the massacre.

Simoun's plan fails, and he is forced to flee. Mortally wounded and poisoned, he seeks refuge with Padre Florentino, a wise and compassionate priest. In his final moments, Simoun confesses his true identity and his failed revenge plot. He dies, and Padre Florentino throws Simoun's treasure—the source of so much greed and corruption—into the sea, symbolizing the rejection of violence and material wealth as means to achieve justice.

MAJOR THEMES:

1. REVOLUTION VERSUS REFORM
The novel explores the tension between peaceful reform and violent revolution. While Simoun advocates for armed uprising, other characters like Basilio and Padre Florentino represent more moderate approaches. The novel questions whether violence can ever lead to true justice.

2. CORRUPTION AND MORAL DECAY
"El Filibusterismo" depicts a society in advanced stages of moral corruption, where greed, hypocrisy, and abuse of power have become normalized. Both the colonizers and some Filipinos are shown to be complicit in this decay.

3. THE FAILURE OF EDUCATION AND ASSIMILATION
Unlike the first novel's optimistic view of education, this sequel shows how the colonial system deliberately sabotages Filipino education to maintain control. The students' failed attempt to establish an academy demonstrates that the system will never willingly grant equality.

4. REVENGE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
Simoun's quest for revenge ultimately destroys him and endangers innocent people. The novel suggests that revenge, like revolution, can become as destructive as the oppression it seeks to overthrow.

5. SACRIFICE AND MARTYRDOM
Many characters sacrifice themselves or their dreams for various causes. The novel examines what it means to die for a principle and whether such sacrifices lead to meaningful change.

6. GREED AND MATERIALISM
The title "The Reign of Greed" reflects how material wealth corrupts individuals and institutions. Simoun's treasure becomes a symbol of how the pursuit of wealth leads to moral bankruptcy.

MAIN CHARACTERS:

SIMOUN (CRISOSTOMO IBARRA) - The protagonist and antagonist, a wealthy jeweler who is actually Ibarra in disguise. Consumed by revenge, he manipulates the colonial system to provoke a revolution. He represents the path of violent resistance and the dangers of allowing hatred to consume one's soul.

PAULITA GÓMEZ - Isagani's former sweetheart who chooses to marry the wealthy Juanito Peláez instead. She represents Filipinos who prioritize material comfort and social status over principles and true love.

PADRE FLORENTINO - A wise and compassionate Filipino priest who represents the moral conscience of the novel. He counsels patience and faith, believing that justice will come in God's time, not through human violence.

KABESANG TALES (TELESFORO JUAN DE DIOS) - A farmer who loses his land to the friars and becomes a bandit after his daughter Juli is taken. He represents the common Filipino driven to desperation by injustice.

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FROM NOLI ME TANGERE:

The sequel shows how characters have evolved over thirteen years:
- Ibarra has transformed from an idealistic reformer into the vengeful Simoun
- Basilio has grown from a traumatized child into an educated young man
- Padre Salví has risen in power and become even more corrupt
- The colonial system has become more entrenched and oppressive

SYMBOLISM:

THE TREASURE: Simoun's jewels represent the corrupting influence of wealth and power. When Padre Florentino throws them into the sea, it symbolizes the rejection of material solutions to spiritual and moral problems.

THE LAMP: The bomb disguised as a wedding gift represents how beauty and celebration can hide deadly intentions, and how violence can masquerade as progress.

THE SEA: The ocean that receives Simoun's treasure represents nature's indifference to human greed and the cleansing power of letting go of material attachments.

IMPACT AND LEGACY:
"El Filibusterismo" completed Rizal's literary indictment of Spanish colonial rule. Together with "Noli Me Tangere," it provided the intellectual foundation for the Philippine Revolution. The novel's exploration of the limits of peaceful reform and the temptation of violent resistance resonated deeply with Filipinos who had experienced decades of failed reform efforts.

The Spanish authorities recognized the novel's revolutionary potential and used it as evidence against Rizal during his trial in 1896. Ironically, while Rizal himself advocated for peaceful reform, his novels inspired the revolutionary movement that would eventually lead to Philippine independence.

RIZAL'S MESSAGE:
Through the tragic figure of Simoun and the wise counsel of Padre Florentino, Rizal presents a complex meditation on revolution and reform. While acknowledging the failures of peaceful reform and the justifiable anger of the oppressed, the novel ultimately rejects violence as a solution.

Padre Florentino's final words suggest that suffering must be endured with patience and that true change comes through moral and spiritual transformation, not through violence and revenge. However, the novel also makes clear that the colonial system's injustices cannot continue indefinitely without consequences.

COMPARISON WITH NOLI ME TANGERE:
While "Noli Me Tangere" offered hope through education and peaceful reform, "El Filibusterismo" presents a darker reality where such hopes have been crushed. The first novel ends with tragedy but some possibility of redemption; the second novel ends with death and the acknowledgment that the struggle for justice will be long and painful.

Together, the two novels present a complete picture of Philippine society under colonial rule and the various responses to oppression—from peaceful reform to violent revolution—while ultimately advocating for moral integrity and the long-term transformation of society through education and enlightenment.

RELEVANCE TODAY:
"El Filibusterismo" remains relevant as a study of how oppression can radicalize even the most idealistic individuals, and how the failure to address injustice peacefully can lead to violence. It serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of addressing grievances before they explode into conflict. The novel also explores timeless questions about the ethics of revolution, the price of revenge, and the true meaning of patriotism and sacrifice.
