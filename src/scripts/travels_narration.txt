DR. JOSÉ RIZAL'S TRAVELS AROUND THE WORLD

===========================================
OVERVIEW OF RIZAL'S JOURNEYS
===========================================

Dr. José Rizal was not only a national hero but also a world traveler who visited numerous countries across four continents. His travels from 1882 to 1896 exposed him to different cultures, political systems, and societies, which profoundly influenced his thinking and writings.
