    "summary": "Noli Me Tangere is a social novel written by José Rizal that exposes the injustices of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. The story follows Crisostomo Ibarra, a young Filipino who returns home after studying in Europe with hopes of reforming society through education and peaceful means. Upon his return, he is confronted by widespread corruption, abuse of power, and moral decay perpetuated by friars and government officials.\n\nThroughout the novel, Rizal reveals the suffering of ordinary Filipinos, particularly through tragic characters like Sisa, whose sons fall victim to cruelty and injustice. The relationship between Ibarra and Maria Clara highlights the personal cost of colonial oppression, as love and family are destroyed by manipulation and religious authority.\n\nAs Ibarra attempts to build a school to uplift Filipino youth, he encounters resistance from those who benefit from the existing system. His disillusionment grows as reform proves impossible within a deeply corrupt structure. By the end of the novel, Rizal emphasizes that awareness, unity, and national consciousness are necessary for genuine change, making Noli Me Tangere a foundational work in the Philippine nationalist movement.",
